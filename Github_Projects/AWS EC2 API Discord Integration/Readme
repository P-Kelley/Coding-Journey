This section includes some simple AWS EC2 instance handling with discord APIs. If you are unfamilar with AWS EC2 instances I reccomend udemy courses covering the AWS basics. The cloud practitioner certification is a good place to begin. One course I reccomend is from Stephane Maarek. https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/.
